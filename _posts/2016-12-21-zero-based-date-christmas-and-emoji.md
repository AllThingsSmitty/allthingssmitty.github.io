Here's a quick tip if you're starting out with JavaScript: which of the following values passed to the `getMonth()` and `getDate()` methods will print December 25?

```javascript
11,24
11,25
12,25
```

If you answered `11,25`, have some egg nog and an extra piece of ribbon candy, you're doing awesome.

## Zero-based counting

JavaScript counters start at 0. But it's important to know that not every method in the `Date` object returns a zero-based number. Specifically, `getMonth()` counts from 0, whereas `getDate()` counts from 1.

Months can also be represented as a string name, so using zero-based counting for `getMonth()` makes it possible to index months into an array, e.g.:

```javascript
let months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr'...];
months[new Date().getMonth()];
```

But if you're starting to wonder, "Why does this method count from 0, and this method count from 1?", the answer is a matter of practicality: it's because the `Date` class in Java does it this way.

So there's a bit of nuance with counting using some of the JavaScript `Date` methods. And we know that `11,25` will print December 25.

## Okay, is it Christmas yet?
