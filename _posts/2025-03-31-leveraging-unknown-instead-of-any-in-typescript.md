In TypeScript, you may have heard that the `any` type is seen as a kind of "get out of jail free" card. It allows any value to be assigned to a variable of type `any`, which effectively disabling TypeScript's static type checking. That might be convenient in certain situations, but it undermines one of the primary benefits of TypeScript: catching errors during development. If you use `any` liberally, you might end up with a codebase that's no safer than regular JavaScript.

## An "unknown" alternative

The `unknown` type is a safer, more restrictive alternative to `any`. It lets you assign any value to a variable but requires type checking before use, unlike `any`, which allows operations without checks.

Let's take a look:

```js
let value: unknown;

value = 10; // OK
value = "hello"; // OK

// The following would raise a TypeScript error
let strLength: number = value.length; // Error: Object is of type "unknown"
```

With `unknown`, the TypeScript compiler won't allow you to perform operations that may not be valid for the assigned value unless you first check its type.

### Is "unknown" really better than "any"?

A few things to consider:

-	**Type safety:** `unknown` requires explicit type checks before performing operations. ü¶∫
-	**Better tooling:** TypeScript provides improved autocompletion and error messages with `unknown`. üß∞
-	**Improved maintainability:** `unknown` encourages safer, more maintainable code. üëçüèª

Using `unknown` with a type check:

```js
let value: unknown = 10;

if (typeof value === "string") {
  // Now TypeScript knows value is a string, so we can safely call string methods
  console.log(value.length); // OK
} else {
  console.log("Value is not a string.");
}
```

With this, TypeScript requires an explicit check (`typeof value === "string"`) before you can safely use the string methods on `value`. This provides an extra layer of safety over `any`.
