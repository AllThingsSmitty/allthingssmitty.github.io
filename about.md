title: Build a better web
---

I build front-end systems that are meant to last.

With roots in UI and web standards, I care about how things look -- but more about how they hold up. I think about tradeoffs, scaling decisions, and the architecture behind the interface.

I've modernized legacy applications, simplified complex systems, and learned that clarity beats cleverness. The web gets better when we build with intention.
