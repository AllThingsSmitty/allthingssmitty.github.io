title: Build a better web
---

I build front-end systems that last.

My roots are in UI and web standards, so I care about how things look. But I care even more about how they hold up over time. I think in tradeoffs, scaling decisions, and the architecture behind the interface.

I've modernized legacy apps, untangled complex systems, and learned that clarity beats cleverness. The web gets better when we build with intention.
