title: Say hi
---

Y'know, people don't say hi as much as they used to. Nowadays everyone seems adverse to it. So let's try it out.

Let's recapture that it's-a-good-day feeling we had when we'd pass a buddy in the hall, "Hey, Bob", by the water cooler, "Good to see you, Deb", or standing next to the faker-than-fake silk plant, "'Sup, Jim! Jimbo! Jimmy crack corn!"

Also, you can email cuz that works well, too: [matt@allthingssmitty.com](mailto:matt@allthingssmitty.com).
